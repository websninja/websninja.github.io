			<h3>High School</h3>
			<p>In Highschool I took a digital media course and a graphic design course where I learned a little bit about some of the programs that I use now in my CIS classes.
			In my digital media class I learned a little bit about web design and HTML code with the program Dreamweaver which was pretty simple and easy but it gave me a little bit of a heads up on this class in terms of having worked with HTML before.
		I really loved the Digital Media class, it was probably my favorite class I ever took in high school and the teacher was probably my favorite teacher as well. If it werent for my teacher and that class I probably wouldn't be pursuing CIS.  </p>


			<p>The graphic design class that I took in high school also had a major impact on my path to CIS. In this class I learned a lot of different things while working with photoshop and illustrator. These programs without
			a doubt will help me in the future, especially if I decide to do more web development things which I think I will. In this class I also learned about screen printing
		which I have done a lot since learning about it, I dont think that it really impacted my choice of CIS as a degree but it has definitely become a hobby and at times a source of income for me and my friends.</p>

			<h3>College</h3>
			<p>I'm currently pursuing a degree in CIS, I have started the programming and the networking sequence. My goal is to get both degrees and I am currently set to graduate in the fall next year with networking, but my plan is to come back for another year to get the programming degree as well.
			I think having both degrees will help me out in the long run, I think that it makes me look a lot more well rounded and even though I will not have my bachelors degree I will have two associates in the CIS field and company's will hopefully see that I know what I'm doing and am able to do whatever they need from me.
		My hope is that a company will hire me for either networking or programming and when I get in I can give them the best of both. The networking degrees are only available through community colleges so I beleive that the associate degree instead of a bachelors isn't going to hurt me at all. I think being an IT person would be a good job for me but ultimately I think I'd like to do programming,
	I've learned C++ and I hope to get certifications in a few other languages which I dont think will be very hard considering object oriented languages are so similar, I feel like i can learn them with ease since it is basically just the syntax that I will need to learn.
I feel that most companies just wanna see that you know a language and if you can prove to them that you do know a language then they will be confident that you can learn another.</p>
