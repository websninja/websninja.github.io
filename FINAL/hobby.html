			<h3>Sports</h3>
			<p>I love all things sports, my favorite things to do include playing them and watching them. My favorite sports are similar to most people as I love the big 3,
			which are football, basketball and baseball. I love watching football and I especially love rooting on my LSU Tigers and New Orleans Saints as well as the Detroit Lions.
		I pretty much root for all the Detroit and New Orleans teams but as I've said numerous times LSU is king. </p>
			<p>When it comes to playing sports Football and Baseball are what I was best at but Baseball specifically was where I excelled the most. I had college offers coming out of highschool but I had a serious shoulder injury in summer league play that made schools back off,
			I still had some comitable offers but I ultimately decided to pursue other things which I now unfortunately regret. If I were able to go back and do it over again I would choose to keep playing.</p>

			<h3>Video Games</h3>
			<p>I'm a HUGE gamer, and I love playing all sorts of games. I play a lot of sports games but I also play a lot of shooters. I'd say the game that I've played more than any other would be the GTA series.
			I have loved every one of the GTA games that have come out, and they usually take over my life for a few months when they first come out. GTA 5 has been out for over 2 years now and I still play that game pretty religiously.
		Other games that I like include the Elder Scrolls games which are also some of my favorite and ultimately take over my life for awhile after they drop, and I also love the Mass Effect series which are all some of my favorite games as well.
	I could go on and on about the games that I love to play and I think that my love of games has really had a huge impact on my love for technology and if not for video games I probably wouldnt be in this web design class.</p>
