			<p> My name is Jake Hawkins and I am trying to learn more about computers and technology.</p>

			<h3>Essentials</h3>
			<p>I was born in Baton Rouge Louisiana. I have a mom and dad and one brother and we all get along great. My family has always been apart of everything I do and they have always supported me and pushed me to great things. If it were not for my family I would probably not be taking this class today because I'd be trying to get some super easy degree probably.</p>
			<p>My parents got me and my brother involved in sports at an early age and that helped me learn important lessons in teamwork and leadership and helped form the person I am today. I loved playing football and baseball and if it wasnt for a serious shoulder injury I'd still be playing baseball</p>

			<h3>Louisiana</h3>
			<p>Louisiana had a major impact on who I am today. The culture has stuck with me and I beleive it will always have an affect on who I am as a person. From the good food
			to the great music and the Love of sports I think Louisiana represents a lot of who I am. One major thing that Louisiana has given me is LSU. LSU is my favorite team to root for and people from the south take this to a whole other level.
		LSU sports represent a religion to me and my family and the people of Louisiana.</p>

			<h3>Move to Michigan</h3>
			<p>We moved to michigan when I was 14 years old and I think that made the Louisiana culture in me stronger if that makes any sense. I do all that I can to get cajun food whenever I can and I think that my fandom of LSU has increased.
			There are so many University of Michigan and Michigan State fans around that it makes me want to represent LSU even more. I've lived here for awhile now and I am still every bit as much a fan. Probably the biggest impact Michigan has had on my life is that I am now completely okay with
		snow and love winter sports like skiing and snowboarding and I fully embrace the snow which I would have never thought possible when I first moved here. </p>
