			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>I grew up in Louisiana and I am an avid sports fan. I love watching all sports and I especially love playing them.</p>
			<p>I also love video games and I probably play them a little too much but thats probably where my fascination with technology started.</p>
			<p>Ever since I was a kid I've always loved messing around with technology and having the coolest gadgets in my life.</p>
